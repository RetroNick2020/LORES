It generates a random maze and start the player on the left border. A randomly
placed exit will be on the right border. Find your way across the maze using
the folowing keys:

- up arrow   = move up
- down arrow = move down
- left arrow = move left
- right      = move right

You can exit the game with the ESCAPE key. Four version of the EXE are build:
