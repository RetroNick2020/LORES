===========

A simple game to show off the tile and sprite library.

It generates a random maze and start the player on the left border. A randomly
placed exit will be on the right border. Find your way across the maze using
the following keys:

- up arrow   = move up
- down arrow = move down
- left arrow = move left
- right      = move right

You can exit the game with the ESCAPE key. Two version of the EXE are build:

- MAZERUNR.EXE = Release version
- MAZEPROF.EXE = Border color profiling on CGA

The game will print out a seed value and time once you make it to the exit. You can provide this seed value as an optional parameter to Maze Runner to generate the same maze again. This way you can try and beat your previous score, or some one else's.
